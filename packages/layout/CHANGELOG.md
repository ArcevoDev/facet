# @arcevo/facet-layout

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(cli): add clean/scripts/prep/up commands + doctor dep detection + alias-aware imports; layout: full/rail sidebar + verified section behavior

  CLI — new commands for consumer-safety and repo hygiene:

  - `facet clean`: detects dependencies already bundled by @arcevo/facet-components
    (radix primitives, lucide-react, cmdk, input-otp, qrcode.react, react-hook-form,
    sonner, class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge), removes them from the
    consumer's manifests, rewrites shadcn/ui-style imports (and direct radix/lucide
    imports) to `@arcevo/facet-components`, and deletes dead local `ui/` components.
    Safe by default: `--dry-run` shows the plan, prompts for confirmation (or `-y`),
    and prints the exact remove command for the detected package manager instead of
    auto-running it.
  - `facet scripts`: adds useful npm scripts (docs:dev/build/preview, quality
    lint/typecheck/test/build, facet:doctor/clean/prep) to package.json, never
    overwriting scripts the consumer already has.
  - `facet prep`: pre-go-live sync — checks facet deps are current (pkg), audits
    repo health (doctor), and runs the consumer's own typecheck/build/test when the
    scripts exist. Non-destructive.
  - `facet up`: applies the facet package updates (non-dry-run sibling of
    `facet update`) using the detected package manager.
  - `facet doctor` now also reports dependencies that @arcevo/facet-components
    already bundles and suggests `facet clean`.
  - `facet docs init` UX fixes: "Decide for me" now skips the question prompts
    (it previously asked everything then discarded the answers); the summary says
    where files actually land per framework (Next: src/app/docs + src/lib/docs;
    Remix: app/routes/docs + src/lib/docs); and it installs the facet packages
    automatically at the resolved latest versions instead of printing the command.
  - Alias-aware imports: the generators read tsconfig/jsconfig `paths` (and common
    framework aliases like `@/`, `~/`) and emit a configured alias when one fits,
    else a correct relative path. Fixes generated route imports that pointed at
    the wrong location.

  Layout — ConsoleLayout keeps `mode="full"` and `mode="rail"` only (the overlay
  variant is removed; it was never released and did not display as intended). The
  sidebar section expand/collapse + auto-open-active-section behavior is now
  covered by tests, and the mobile Sheet close behavior is verified.

### Patch Changes

- 251a0e4: fix: alert success/warning colors, mobile table overflow, auth docs cleanup

  - components: Alert success and warning variants now use their semantic
    text colors (text-success green, text-warning amber) matching the
    destructive variant, instead of text-foreground. Added an alert test.
  - layout: the ConsoleLayout main area gets min-w-0 so wide tables scroll
    inside their own overflow-x-auto container instead of overflowing the
    page on mobile.
  - docs: remove the /auth/forms page (its LoginForm demo rendered a blank
    page) and the redundant /auth/layouts page (covered by the Ecosystem
    Layout page). Cleaned up the login-form manifest entry, variant, and
    usage. Fixed stale docs claims: 52 -> 57 components, added facet-cli to
    the package list, corrected the publishing note (CI is validation-only)
    and the fintechAuthPreset -> fintechPreset snippet name.

- 2dae8e2: fix: mobile overflow, contained layout docs, settings menu cleanup

  - layout: responsive `p-4 md:p-8` main padding, `px-4 md:px-6` topbar,
    and a `w-40 sm:w-64` search trigger so the docs shell fits phones.
  - docs: the /layout page documents full app shells code-first (their
    fixed-position sidebars escaped the docs shell); standalone Sidebar +
    Topbar and pill Navbar keep live previews.
  - docs: settings gear no longer duplicates the theme toggle (it has its
    own icon); it now shows ecosystem links + a Ctrl+K search hint.
  - docs: accordion previews now show 3 items so spacing consistency is
    visible; Docs Package + Layout pages moved under the Ecosystem section.
  - apps/docs + apps/landing vercel.json SPA-fallback rewrites fix 404s on
    deep-route refresh.
